\description{
This function refreshes the mailing list files by checking the contents of a specified folder.
If the folder is empty, it calls \code{download_pipermail} to download all pipermail files from start_year_month to the current month.
If the folder contains already-downloaded mbox files, it identifies the most recent month, deletes that file, and redownloads it
along with all future months up to the current real-life month.

The naming convention of files is kaiaulu_YYYYMM.mbox, and the function uses this pattern to identify the most recent month.
After deleting the most recent file, the function ensures that the month is redownloaded, along with all subsequent months up to the current month.
Redownloading the most recent file makes sure that any files added in that month after the latest refresh are included.
