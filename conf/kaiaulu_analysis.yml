# Project Configuration File #
#
# To perform analysis on open source projects, you need to manually
# collect some information from the project's website. As there is
# no standardized website format, this file serves to distill
# important data source information so it can be reused by others
# and understood by Kaiaulu.
#
# Please check https://github.com/sailuh/kaiaulu/tree/master/conf to
# see if a project configuration file already exists. Otherwise, we
# would appreciate if you share your curated file with us by sending a
# Pull Request: https://github.com/sailuh/kaiaulu/pulls
#
# Note, you do NOT need to specify this entire file to conduct analysis.
# Each R Notebook uses a different portion of this file. To know what
# information is used, see the project configuration file section at

# Third Party Tools Configuration #
#
# See Kaiaulu's README.md for details on how to setup these tools.
tool:
  # Depends allow to parse file-file static dependencies.
#  depends:
    # accepts one language at a time: cpp, java, ruby, python, pom
    # You can obtain this information on OpenHub or the project GiHub page right pane.
#    code_language: java
    # Specify which types of Dependencies to keep - see the Depends tool README.md for details.
#    keep_dependencies_type:
#      - Cast
#      - Call
#      - Import
#      - Return

  # Uctags allows finer file-file dependency parsing (e.g. functions, classes, structs)
  uctags:
    # See https://github.com/sailuh/kaiaulu/wiki/Universal-Ctags for details
    # What types of file-file dependencies should be considered? If all
    # dependencies are specified, Kaiaulu will use all of them if available.

# Analysis Configuration #
analysis:
  # You can specify the intervals in 2 ways: window, range or enumeration
  window:
    # If using gitlog, use start_commit and end_commit. Timestamp is inferred from gitlog
    #start_commit: 224a729f44f554af311ca52cf01b105ded87499b
    #end_commit: 74cd4d4835a02e01e310476c6776192ad0d97173
    # Use datetime only if no gitlog is used in the analysis.
    # start_datetime: 2020-05-23 15:12:20
    # end_datetime: 2023-12-08 11:50:21
    # You can provide a set of dates to create time windows between these
    # dates for evolutionary analyses.
    ranges:
      - 2020-05-23 15:12:20
      - 2020-06-25 11:47:58
      - 2020-08-18 08:09:27
      - 2021-05-30 06:34:04

      - 2023-12-08 11:50:21
    # Instead of manually providing dates, you can also generate
    # time windows automatically by specifying a desired window size in
    # days. Note that explicit ranges will be preferred and used by default
    # if provided.
    #size_days: 365
#  enumeration:
     # If using gitlog, specify the commits
#    commit:
#      - 9eae9e96f15e1f216162810cef4271a439a74223
#      - f1d2d568776b3708dd6a3077376e2331f9268b04

     # Use datetime only if no gitlog is used in the analysis. Timestamp is inferred from gitlog
#    datetime:
#      - 2013-05-01 00:00:00
#      - 2013-08-01 00:00:00
#      - 2013-11-01 00:00:00
  # You can pass additional parameters for the CLI
