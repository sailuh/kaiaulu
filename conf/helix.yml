# To perform analysis on open source projects, you need to manually
# collect some information from the project's website. As there is
# no standardized website format, this file serves to distill
# important data source information so it can be reused by others
# and understood by Kaiaulu.
#
# Please check https://github.com/sailuh/kaiaulu/tree/master/conf to
# see if a project configuration file already exists. Otherwise, we
# would appreciate if you share your curated file with us by sending a
# Pull Request: https://github.com/sailuh/kaiaulu/pulls
#
# Note, you do NOT need to specify this entire file to conduct analysis.
# Each R Notebook uses a different portion of this file. To know what
# information is used, see the project configuration file section at
