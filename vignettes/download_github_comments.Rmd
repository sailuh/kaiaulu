# Introduction


In this Vignette, I will show how to download GitHub comments from both Issue and Pull Requests. This data may be useful if development communication occurs through issues or pull requests in GitHub in addition or instead of mailing lists. For details on how to merge various communication sources, see the `reply_communication_showcase.Rmd` notebook. The parsed communication table from GitHub comments by `parse_github_comments` has the same format as the mailing list and JIRA comments tables. In turn, the function expects as input the table generated at the end of this notebook.

This notebook assumes you are familiar with obtaining a GitHub token. For details, see the `github_api_showcase.Rmd` notebook. The functions in Kaiaulu will assume you have a token available, which can be passed as parameter. 

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
require(kaiaulu)
require(data.table)
require(jsonlite)
require(knitr)
require(magrittr)
require(gt)
```


# GitHub Project's Comments

In this notebook, we are interested in obtaining comment data from the GitHub API. Development communication may occur in either issues or pull requests. [The GitHub API Pulls documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls) states that _'Comments on pull requests can be managed via the Issue Comments API. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like manipulating assignees, labels and milestones, are provided within the Issues API.'_

Further details are noted on the issue endpoint: _'Note: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.'_

While the above is true for **comments**, the first message of every issue and every pull request (which also include a title) is not regarded by GitHub as a comment. For example, suppose one issue was opened by Author A, and contain only one reply by Author B. In this case, A and B established communication, and we would like this interaction to be reflected in the final table. However, if we were to only use the **comments** endpoint, we would only obtain Author's B comment, and not Author's A. The same is true in Pull Requests.

Therefore, in this Notebook we have to rely on three endpoints from the GitHub API: The `Issue endpoint` to obtain the "first comment" of every issue, the `Pull Request endpoint` to obtain the "first comment" of every pull request, then finally the `Issue and Pull Request Comment endpoint`, which provides comments for both issue and pull requests together.


# Project Configuration File

To use the pipeline, you must specify the organization and project of interest, and your token. Obtain a github token following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

```{r}
conf <- yaml::read_yaml("../conf/kaiaulu.yml")
save_path <- path.expand(conf[["issue_tracker"]][["github"]][["replies"]]) 
save_path_issue_refresh <- path.expand(conf[["issue_tracker"]][["github"]][["refresh"]])
save_path_issue <- paste0(save_path,"/issue/")
save_path_pull_request <- paste0(save_path,"/pull_request/")
save_path_issue_or_pr_comments <- paste0(save_path,"/issue_or_pr_comment/")
save_path_commit <- paste0(save_path,"/commit/")
# Path you wish to save all raw data. A folder with the repo name and sub-folders will be created.
owner <- conf[["issue_tracker"]][["github"]][["owner"]] # Has to match github organization (e.g. github.com/sailuh)
repo <- conf[["issue_tracker"]][["github"]][["repo"]] # Has to match github repository (e.g. github.com/sailuh/perceive)
# your file github_token (a text file) contains the GitHub token API
token <- scan("~/.ssh/github_token",what="character",quiet=TRUE)
```

# Collecting Data via GitHub API

In this section we obtain the raw data (.json) containing all information the GitHub API endpoint provides. We parse the information of interest in the subsequent section.  


```{r eval = FALSE}
dir.create(paste0(save_path))
```

## Issues

First we will obtain all the issues (i.e. "first comments"). 

```{r Collect all issues, eval = FALSE}
# make initial API CALL
gh_response <- github_api_project_issue(owner,repo,token)
dir.create(save_path_issue)
# Make subsequent API calls and write to JSON file along save path
github_api_iterate_pages(token,gh_response,
                         save_path_issue,
                         prefix="issue",
                         verbose=TRUE)
```

# REFRESH Issues

The above function call downloads all the available issues less than the specified limit (default to API limit). The following chunk allows the downloading of issues that have been created only after the most recently created issue already downloaded. This allows the user to 'refresh' their data or continue downloading if a rate limit was previously reached. 
```{r Collect all issues, eval = FALSE}
#gh call but with date
dir.create(save_path_issue_refresh)
gh_response <- github_api_project_issue_refresh(owner,
                                                repo,
                                                token,
                                                save_path_issue, 
                                                save_path_issue_refresh, 
                                                verbose=TRUE)
dir.create(save_path_issue_refresh)
github_api_iterate_pages(token,gh_response,
                         save_path_issue_refresh,
                         prefix="issue",
                         verbose=TRUE)
```
## Pull Requests

Next we obtain the "first comment" of every pull request.

```{r Collect all pull requests, eval = FALSE}
gh_response <- github_api_project_pull_request(owner,repo,token)
dir.create(save_path_pull_request)
github_api_iterate_pages(token,gh_response,
                         save_path_pull_request,
                         prefix="pull_request",
                         verbose=TRUE)
```
## Issues and Pull Requests Comments

Finally we obtain the comments of both issue and pull requests (which does not contain the data obtained in the prior two endpoints).

```{r Collect all issue and pull request comments, eval = FALSE}
gh_response <- github_api_project_issue_or_pr_comments(owner,repo,token)
dir.create(save_path_issue_or_pr_comments)
github_api_iterate_pages(token,gh_response,
                         save_path_issue_or_pr_comments,
                         prefix="issue_or_pr_comment",
                         verbose=TRUE)
```
#REFRESH ISSUE OR PR COMMENT

Similar to the refresh of the issues, this chunk allows for the downloading of comments that have been created since the most recently created date among data already downloaded. This allows us to 'refresh' the comments, downloading comments made since that date or continue downloading if a rate limit was reached. 
```{r Collect all issues, eval = FALSE}
#gh call but with date
# get the data
gh_response_issue_or_pr_comment <- github_api_project_issue_or_pr_comment_refresh(owner,
                                                                                  repo,
                                                                                  token, save_path_issue_or_pr_comments, verbose=TRUE)

# create direcetory and iterate over data
dir.create(save_path_issue_or_pr_comments)
github_api_iterate_pages(token,gh_response_issue_or_pr_comment,
                         save_path_issue_or_pr_comments,
                         prefix="issue_or_pr_comment",
                         verbose=TRUE)
```

## Obtaining author's name and e-mail

The three endpoints used above do not contain author and e-mail information, only the developers GitHub ids. This is a problem, if the project being studied contains communication data outside the GitHub ecosystem (e.g. uses JIRA as issue tracker). In order to link developers to other sources, we need both author and e-mail information.

To do so, we can use the committer endpoint. 

```{r Collect all authors and committers name and e-mail, eval = FALSE}
gh_response <- github_api_project_commits(owner,repo,token)
dir.create(save_path_commit)
github_api_iterate_pages(token,gh_response,
                         save_path_commit,
                         prefix="commit",
                         verbose=TRUE)

```

# Parsing Raw Data to Csv

To parse raw data, we use the associated endpoint parser functions. Keep in mind these functions only parse a subset of all the information in the json ("column wise"). Please consult with the GitHub API or inspect the raw data directly to see all information which is available. 

Note the parsed data will include the **body** column, but it is not shown in the Notebook as it breaks the table formatting due to commas in the text when rendered in HTML.

## Issues 

The issue endpoint provides issue-related metadata such as labels. This can be helpful for the analysis of bug counts, if the project uses bug labels.

```{r}
all_issue <- lapply(list.files(save_path_issue,
                                     full.names = TRUE),read_json)
all_issue <- lapply(all_issue,
                                   github_parse_project_issue)
all_issue <- rbindlist(all_issue,fill=TRUE)

head(all_issue)  %>%
  gt(auto_align = FALSE) 
```

# Refresh parser
```{r}
all_issue_items <- lapply(list.files(save_path_issue_refresh, full.names = TRUE), function(file) {
  # Read the full JSON file
  data <- read_json(file)
  
  # Extract the 'items' part
  return(data$items)
})
all_issue <- lapply(all_issue,
                                   github_parse_project_issue)
all_issue <- rbindlist(all_issue,fill=TRUE)

head(all_issue)  %>%
  gt(auto_align = FALSE) 
```

## Pull Requests

Similarly to the Issue API, we can also obtain other metadata from pull requests, including their labels.

```{r}
all_pr <- lapply(list.files(save_path_pull_request,
                                     full.names = TRUE),read_json)
all_pr <- lapply(all_pr,
                                   github_parse_project_pull_request)
all_pr <- rbindlist(all_pr,fill=TRUE)

tail(all_pr,1)  %>%
  gt(auto_align = FALSE) 
```

## Issue or PR Comments

```{r}
all_issue_or_pr_comments <- lapply(list.files(save_path_issue_or_pr_comments,
                                     full.names = TRUE),read_json)
all_issue_or_pr_comments <- lapply(all_issue_or_pr_comments,
                                   github_parse_project_issue_or_pr_comments)
all_issue_or_pr_comments <- rbindlist(all_issue_or_pr_comments,fill=TRUE)

head(all_issue_or_pr_comments,2)  %>%
  gt(auto_align = FALSE) 
```



# Combining Issue and Pull Request communication

If our interest is to observe all the development communication, we may regard both the opening issue, pull request and comments as simply "replies" in a single table. 

Note because we obtain the authors and committers name and e-mail, **only comments made by developers who made at least one commit will contain their name and e-mail**. That is, people who only post issues and comment will not have that information available, and instead will have their github user as part of the `reply_from` column. Therefore, identity match is likely not to work when no author name and e-mail is available. If you are analyzing social smells, this will not be a problem for org silo and missing link (as their condition require code changes). However, since radio silence only consider the mailing list network, caution must be exercised. 


Below we show the result of such merge, including the name and e-mail fields obtained from the commit table. As before, we do not display the body column to prevent breaking the HTML format. 

```{r}
replies <- parse_github_replies(save_path)

tail(replies,2)  %>%
  gt(auto_align = FALSE) 
```
